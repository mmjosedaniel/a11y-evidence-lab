# A11y Evidence Lab

## Overview

A11y Evidence Lab is a planned accessibility analysis application whose goal is to help a frontend developer turn automated findings into traceable, guidance-backed remediation decisions that can be reviewed and verified, with QA engineers as secondary users. For one user-supplied public HTTPS page at a time, it would run a deterministic browser scan, preserve minimized evidence behind each finding, retrieve relevant guidance from a curated corpus, determine whether that finding's evidence and guidance are sufficient for generation, and use the selected local or Groq-hosted LLM to generate cited explanations, remediation proposals, and required manual checks through one provider-neutral contract. The portfolio MVP treats that URL as trusted developer/operator input; the user remains responsible for authorization and for choosing an appropriate public target.

The portfolio MVP deliberately scans exactly three axe-core rules: `image-alt`, `label`, and `color-contrast`. One atomic, provider-independent scan lists every axe violation node reported by those rules; native `incomplete` observations remain visible and distinct from findings. A completed scan may validly report zero findings, but neither zero nor any other count is an accessibility or compliance verdict. A navigation error, timeout, or scan failure remains visible and is never presented as a completed zero-finding or silently partial result.

This is a deliberate portfolio-scope decision. The project exists to demonstrate the complete implementation and integration of deterministic browser scanning, minimized evidence capture, curated RAG through a bounded LangChain role, structured AI generation, human review, and conservative rescan comparison—not to build a production website crawler or hostile-URL isolation product. It accepts one trusted public page target per analysis run, but performs no link discovery, crawling, authenticated-page access, bulk generation, or broader rule coverage. The fixed synthetic image, label, and contrast scenarios remain reproducible evaluation inputs; they are not user-submitted runtime page inputs. [OD-020](docs/requirements/DELIVERY_READINESS_AND_OPEN_DECISIONS.md#od-020--authorized-public-page-analysis-scope) records the analysis workflow, and [OD-021](docs/requirements/DELIVERY_READINESS_AND_OPEN_DECISIONS.md#od-021--trusted-operator-url-boundary-for-the-portfolio-mvp) with [ADR-0018](docs/architecture/decisions/ADR-0018-trusted-operator-url-boundary.md) records its deliberately narrow trust boundary.

The MVP assumes benign developer input and makes no production URL-isolation claim; security hardening for untrusted targets is deferred until a demonstrated product need justifies it.

Users would review each proposal and could approve, edit, or reject it before it becomes an accepted remediation plan. Subsequent scans would first determine whether the evidence pair is comparable; a comparable finding may then be classified as resolved, improved where an ordered measure exists, persistent, regressed, or inconclusive. The application would support accessibility investigation and engineering decisions; it would not provide accessibility certification or legal-compliance determinations, and it would not modify source code automatically.

## Why this matters

Automated accessibility scanners are effective at identifying deterministic issues, but their output often lacks the context engineering teams need to understand impact, select remediation, distinguish automated evidence from human judgment, and verify improvement. A11y Evidence Lab would bring those activities into one traceable workflow.

## Engineering objective

The project objective is to demonstrate the practical use of retrieval-augmented generation in an evidence-centered application without turning the portfolio MVP into a production-scale platform:

- **RAG** would ground explanations and remediation proposals in a curated, versioned accessibility corpus.
- **LangChain** is the initial evaluation baseline for the small retrieve-then-generate integration. For the fixed corpus, it would use in-process `MemoryVectorStore` retrieval with local `embeddinggemma` vectors, exact cosine similarity, and a fixed top three; the MVP has no Chroma or other vector-database service.
- Plain TypeScript application state is sufficient for the first linear workflow and one current human decision at a time.
- Each page analysis would be retained as one versioned `data/runs/<run-id>/run.json` aggregate, with no canonical child files, Markdown report, database, or audit graph.
- **LangGraph** remains a later candidate only if a demonstrated resume or recovery need justifies it.
- **LangSmith** is deferred outside the MVP; content-safe local records and diagnostics are sufficient for the portfolio workflow.

The MVP has exactly two generation modes: developer-managed `qwen3.5:4b` through a separately installed Ollama runtime, or the Groq API as the first and only external provider. Before analysis, the user selects one global mode and sees one concise run-level disclosure; the immutable selection and exact model remain visible for the run and apply to every later eligible finding. Selection performs no provider call or synthetic readiness probe. Each eligible finding still requires an explicit generation action, after which the selected adapter performs only its attempt-time prerequisite check, makes the actual request, and validates the returned structured value. Providers are never mixed, there is no automatic fallback, and provider-invocation provenance exists only when a call is attempted. Local mode remains the recommended initial choice. The fixed Groq evaluation configuration uses model ID `openai/gpt-oss-20b`; this is an evaluation choice, not a release-qualified dependency or availability promise. Local model evaluation remains subject to the documented capacity gate on the existing reference PC; models outside that capacity are excluded. TypeScript, React, and the bounded LangChain role join the other initial evaluation baselines recorded in the [architecture decisions](docs/architecture/decisions/README.md).

## Planned MVP startup and generation setup

The portfolio MVP has no installer, desktop wrapper, Start menu shortcut, or application-controlled webview. The developer starts a local application service on the developer machine and opens its loopback address in Chrome or Edge. The browser is only the unprivileged interface; the local service owns filesystem access, scan-browser automation, the local model-runtime adapter, and the Groq adapter.

For retrieval in either generation mode, the developer manually installs Ollama and runs `ollama pull embeddinggemma` through Ollama's own tooling outside A11y Evidence Lab. Local generation additionally requires `ollama pull qwen3.5:4b`; Groq generation instead requires a Groq credential in the local service. The application does not install or update Ollama, pull or remove models, track acquisition progress, expose a model manager, or provide a separate provider-probe interface. It checks `embeddinggemma` only when retrieval is requested and `qwen3.5:4b` only when an explicit eligible Local generation attempt begins; the actual work and response validation determine success or visible failure. Packaging and installer work are deferred until a demonstrated distribution need justifies them. [ADR-0020](docs/architecture/decisions/ADR-0020-manual-developer-managed-local-model-setup.md) records this developer-managed setup boundary.

The canonical local artifact for a page analysis is one versioned `data/runs/<run-id>/run.json` aggregate containing the scan and the current nested per-finding workflow data. The MVP generates no Markdown report and adds no database or independently versioned child-record lifecycle. [ADR-0019](docs/architecture/decisions/ADR-0019-in-process-exact-vector-search.md), [ADR-0021](docs/architecture/decisions/ADR-0021-single-file-run-aggregate.md), and [OD-022](docs/requirements/DELIVERY_READINESS_AND_OPEN_DECISIONS.md#od-022--portfolio-mvp-yagni-simplification) record these portfolio-first YAGNI decisions.

## Planned workflow

1. The user enters one trusted, authorized public HTTPS URL for which they are responsible, selects the global Local or Groq generation mode after its concise run-level disclosure, and activates **Analyze** to start one scan under the [trusted-operator boundary](docs/architecture/decisions/ADR-0018-trusted-operator-url-boundary.md). Mode selection does not contact a provider.
2. In a fresh non-persistent browser context with no imported user profile, credentials, or authentication state, the scan runs exactly `image-alt`, `label`, and `color-contrast`, then [captures every reported violation node and its minimized evidence](docs/architecture/candidates/ACCESSIBILITY_FINDING_EVIDENCE_CAPTURE_ASSESSMENT.md) while keeping native incomplete observations separate. It performs no crawling, clicks, form submission, uploads, or download workflow, uses one ordinary navigation timeout, and cleans up its browser context after success or failure.
3. The application lists the findings; the user selects one finding at a time for [curated guidance retrieval](docs/architecture/candidates/guidance-retrieval/README.md) through the accepted in-process exact-vector path, which returns at most three ranked passages and requires no persistent vector service.
4. For that finding, the application [gates generation on evidence sufficiency, then generates a cited proposal with confidence, uncertainty, and required manual checks—or abstains without a model call](docs/architecture/candidates/EVIDENCE_GROUNDED_REMEDIATION_GENERATION_ASSESSMENT.md). An eligible explicit generation attempt uses only the selected provider and succeeds only after the actual returned value passes application-owned validation.
5. The application [presents that proposal for individual approval, editing, or rejection](docs/architecture/candidates/HUMAN_REMEDIATION_REVIEW_ASSESSMENT.md); it never creates one combined proposal for the page.
6. A later analysis of the same authorized page [compares evidence conservatively per finding](docs/architecture/candidates/RESCAN_EVIDENCE_COMPARISON_ASSESSMENT.md).

For `image-alt` and `label`, a uniquely correlated same-target transition may be classified conservatively as `resolved`, `persistent`, or `regressed`, subject to comparability and evidence gates. For `color-contrast`, the retained contrast margin supplies an ordered measure that can also support `improved` while the finding remains unresolved. Changed or ambiguous live-page structure may require `inconclusive` or `not comparable`. None of these outcomes establishes whole-page accessibility or conformance.
